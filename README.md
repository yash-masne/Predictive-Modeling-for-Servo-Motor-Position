ðŸš€ Title: Predictive Modeling for Servo Motor Position

Introduction:
In my project, I aimed to enhance precision and efficiency in industrial automation systems through predictive modeling. Specifically, I focused on forecasting the position of servo motors, a critical component in numerous automated processes. By leveraging machine learning, I aimed to revolutionize servo motor control, ultimately driving advancements in industrial automation technologies.

Project Overview:
This ambitious project centers on developing a sophisticated predictive model capable of anticipating servo motor positions based on input parameters. Servo motors play a pivotal role in industrial applications, from robotics to automotive assembly lines. By accurately predicting servo motor positions, this project aims to optimize control mechanisms and enhance operational efficiency in industrial settings.

Methodology:
I utilized machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, to construct the predictive model. Using Python's scikit-learn library, I processed the dataset, encoding categorical variables and handling outliers. The data was then split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. The linear regression algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, undergoing rigorous training on the training data.
